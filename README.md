# blogs

I do actually have an actual blogspot [blog](<alexandrastech.blogspot.com>). The suff I put on there tends to be silly little examples that I want to remember. I usually only give the minimum amount of information for something to be useful for me in the future. 

This repo contains articles, things that I have tried to write sort of sensibly that someone else might be able to understand.
